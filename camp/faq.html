  <h2>Upcoming Events</h2>

  <h3>When and where is the next Offline Camp?</h3>
  <p>Offline Camp Oregon 2019 will take place in Grants Pass, Oregon from September 27-30, 2019. (For the health and safety of our campers during the Milepost 97 wildfire, we've postponed the event, which was previously scheduled for August 2-5. <a href="{{ page.root_path }}camp/reschedule">See our detailed announcement.</a>)</p>

  <h3>What if I can't make it?</h3>
  <p>We're working on plans for future iterations of Offline Camp, but we need your
    input to decide where we should head to next. After all, camp should be near all the eager future campers, right? Please <a href="https://offlinecamp.typeform.com/to/V8aSWJ">cast your vote now</a> and ensure we can reach you
    when it's time for the next big announcement!</p>

  <a name="experience"></a>
  <h2>The Offline Camp Experience</h2>

  <h3>The atmosphere</h3>
  <p>Offline Camp is a relaxed-yet-productive weekend with others passionate about Offline First, engaged in deep discussion
    and lighthearted fun. We aim to provide a welcoming, inclusive, and respectful environment for a diverse group of
    participants (see our <a href="{{ page.root_path }}camp/codeofconduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> and
    <a href="{{ page.root_path }}camp/faq.html#diversity">Diversity Statement</a>). We also limit the group to 30 people
    so we can truly have the chance to get to know each other.</p>

  <a name="unconference"></a>
  <h3>Unconference sessions</h3>
  <p>Our content is driven by campers, with attendees nominating and voting on Offline First topics to be discussed
    in unconference sessions. There are multiple discussions on wide-ranging topics happening simultaneously, with
    group recaps to catch you up on sessions you‚Äôve missed. (Many of our past discussion topics are chronicled in our
    <a href="https://medium.com/offline-camp">Medium publication</a>.) Please bring ideas on specific topics you‚Äôd
    like to discuss with the group.</p>

  <a name="passion"></a>
  <h3>Passion talks</h3>
  <p>We also offer campers the opportunity to present 5-minute passion talks on their diverse interests. These
    informal talks don‚Äôt need to be related to Offline First, nor be technical. If you have a hobby or other
    pursuit you‚Äôre excited about, we look forward to hearing about it! (Videos of many of our past passion talks
    have been shared with campers‚Äô permission in our <a href="https://medium.com/offline-camp/passion-talks/home">Medium
    publication</a>.)</p>

  <h3>Conversation and relaxation</h3>
  <p>We believe that the casual conversations we have around the campfire can be as important as our more
    structured discussions. With that in mind, we leave some free time in the schedule for engaging with
    your fellow campers in a relaxing setting. Our ranch is amidst forest and ponds, with walking paths to stroll
    or llamas to visit while you connect with a new friend.</p>

  <h3>Awesomeness</h3>
  <p>The Offline Camp experience is pretty awesome. Seriously, just incredible. Like kittens and Nutella
    all wrapped in one (unless you're allergic to cats or hazelnuts or chocolate, in which case we are
    sad for you). In can be tough to explain in words what makes the camp format so great, so we made these
    <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3-Vs4cmp6yS-5vdT3Xbedxw0TkcMfm8p">videos</a> to show
    you what camp is all about. Whenever we feel blue, we watch them to cheer ourselves up. Enjoy. </p>

  <h2>Location, Lodging, and Food</h2>
  <h3>Where does Offline Camp Oregon take place? How far away is the nearest airport or train station?</h3>
  <p>Offline Camp Oregon will be hosted at Cascade Mountain Ranch in Grants Pass, Oregon. When
    booking your travel, please be careful to allow sufficient travel time. You can
    <a href="https://www.google.com/maps/place/Cascade+Mountain+Ranch+Retreat,+Reunion+Center,+%26+Resort/@42.574362,-123.3404136,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x54c59e2ef2b28483:0xc9b26ff290e88733!8m2!3d42.574362!4d-123.3382249">map the Cascade Mountain Ranch</a> to estimate travel times from nearby transport hubs, including:</p>
      <p>‚úàÔ∏è Rogue Valley International Airport (MFR) in Medford, Oregon<br>
      &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; (regional airport with limited connections)<br>
       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; üöó <em>38 miles / approx. 45 min by car</em></p>
       <p>‚úàÔ∏è Eugene Airport (EUG) in Eugene, Oregon (regional airport with limited connections)<br>

       &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; üöó <em>413 mi / approx. 6 h 30 min by car</em></p>
  <p>The approach to Cascade Mountain Ranch is a bit confusing as there are multiple entrances to the property. <a href="{{ page.root_path }}camp/assets/directions-to-offline-camp-oregon.pdf">Please print these directions</a> to ensure a successful drive to Offline Camp.

  <h3>How can I reach Cascade Mountain Ranch from the airport? Will there be shuttle service or carpooling? </h3>
  <p> We are not planning shuttle service to the ranch, but lots of campers like to carpool! We encourage you
    to <a href="http://offlinefirst.org/chat/">join the Offline First Slack team</a> and connect with your
    fellow campers in the #camp channel to discuss carpooling.</p>
    <p>Be sure your driver has <a href="{{ page.root_path }}camp/assets/directions-to-offline-camp-oregon.pdf">these directions</a> to camp!</p>

  <h3>When should I arrive/depart?</h3>
  <p>Please plan to arrive between 3:00 pm and 6:00 pm on Friday, September 27 so you can get settled in
    before dinner.  We hope that everyone will be able to stay through breakfast on
    Monday, September 30, departing around 11:00 am.  Formal discussions will wrap up just before dinner on
    Sunday, so if you do need to leave Sunday night or early Monday morning, you can, but we‚Äôll miss you.
    (You can visit our <a href="{{ page.root_path }}camp/schedule.html">schedule page</a> for a more
    complete view of the weekend.)</p>

  <a name="camping"></a>
  <h3>Will we really be camping?</h3>
  <p>Not in the traditional pitching-a-tent sense, no. We have a bed reserved for you in one of our lodges.
    But it‚Äôs like summer camp in the sense that we will enjoy each other, enjoy nature, and enjoy lots
    of s‚Äômores.</p>

  <h3>Will we really be offline?</h3>
  <p>Although we‚Äôll be discussing Offline First, we will indeed have limited internet access available in one of our
    two lodges. (Yes, yes, it‚Äôs ironic. We know. Don't worry, we promise to provide a really shoddy connection there,
    and the other lodge is WiFi-free!) Frankly, we think you‚Äôll be so engaged in discussion and s‚Äômore-making with your
    fellow campers that you won‚Äôt be tempted to go online other than to post about how cute the llamas are and how
    jealous everyone else should be.</p>

  <h3>What are the sleeping accommodations like?</h3>
  <p>The lodges at Cascade Mountain Ranch are cozy and rustic. You will have a bed of your own, but it
    will most likely be in a bedroom or bunkroom shared with others.  (The first campers to
    apply get the biggest beds!) We will do our best to accommodate preferences for sharing bedrooms
    with others of specific genders, as shared on our Camper Info Form. Co-ed, private (or semi-private)
    bathrooms will be shared with your fellow campers.  (Some bathrooms have mutliple shower stalls with
    a door or curtain for privacy.) Bedding and bath towels are provided. Because the ranch is run by
    volunteers, you'll be making up your own bed on arrival, stripping it on departure, helping out with
    dishes during the weekend, and all that other stuff that keeps a house running. Thanks in advance
    for pitching in!</p>

  <h3>What meals are provided? Can you accommodate dietary restrictions?</h3>
  <p>We will provide breakfast, lunch, dinner, snacks, and non-alcoholic beverages from Friday dinner
    through Monday breakfast.  (You are welcome to bring your own favorite beverages to enjoy with moderation,
    per our <a href="{{ page.root_path }}camp/codeofconduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.) When you complete your
    Camper Info Form, please share any allergies or dietary restrictions.  We will have vegetarian options
    available at every meal, and our caterers will strive to accommodate other needs as
    shared on your form at least two weeks prior to the event.</p>

  <h3>What should I pack?</h3>
  <p>We‚Äôll share a recommended packing list about a week before the event. Note that bedding and bath towels
    will be provided for you, just like at a hotel. We'll provide hand soap, but you should bring your own
    toiletries (shampoo, conditioner, body wash, toothpaste, etc.).</p>


  <a name="applications"></a>
  <h2>Our Campers and the Application Process</h2>

  <h3>Who is Offline Camp intended for? </h3>

  <p>Offline Camp attendees share a common interest in exploring the challenges of building technology that works in poor network conditions. Some of our campers have been building Offline First solutions for years and some are excited to explore these concepts for the first time. Although many of our participants have a technical background, their roles and technical proficiencies vary. Campers might be developing apps, designing user experiences, managing a product, improving a web browser or technical platform, providing humanitarian services to a community with poor connectivity, or supporting the growth of the Offline First community. The discussions we have at camp are meant to propel the community forward, and we hope all of our campers will be in a position to actively contribute to discussions, walk away with a broader perspective, and have a positive impact on the movement when they return home.</p>

  <p>If you're curious about Offline First but aren't prepared to engage in a weekend of intensive, participatory discussion yet, never fear! We're in the beginning stages of planning for an Offline First conference (of more traditional format) that will better suit the needs of folks who have less experience or would rather absorb info than chime in.</p>

  <p>That doesn't mean, however, that we're favoring people who've been to Offline Camp before. We actually intend to cap the number of alumni we accept this year, in order to ensure we have plenty of new folks joining the community.</p>

  <h3>How does the application process work?</h3>

  <p>Interested in attending Offline Camp? You'll start the process by filling out our <a href="https://offlinecamp.typeform.com/to/q93H7U">Camp Application & Scholarship Request Form</a>.</p>

  <p><strong>We strongly encourage you to apply as soon as possible, as we expect the event to sell out.</strong> (Plus, the campers who apply first get the biggest beds!)</p>

  <p>In order to keep camp feeling cozy, warm, and effective, we intentionally limit ourselves to 30 campers. Depending on how many people apply, we may have some tough decisions to make. Here's how we plan to approach that challenge:

  <p>When you fill out your application for camp, even if you've attended before, please take the time to explain how you're currently involved in Offline First projects or the Offline First community, as well as what topics you're interested in exploring further at camp. (No experience with Offline First projects yet? Tell us why you're excited to get started!)</p>

  <p>After you apply, we'll set up a short call with you, even if you've attended camp before. One of the reasons we want to talk is to make sure you understand Offline Camp's unique format. It can be quite a surprise if you don't know what to expect, and communal living isn't for everyone. It's also incredibly important to us that all applicants have read and understood our <a href="{{ page.root_path }}camp/codeofconduct.html">Code of Conduct</a> so that everyone feels safe and welcome at camp. If you have questions, this is the time to ask!</p>

  <p>We'll also ask you a bit more about your specific interests and the projects you're working on to get a sense of what you'll bring to discussions at camp. If you've attended before, the projects you're working on or specific areas you're interested in may have changed since your last Offline Camp experience. We want to know what you hope to learn and contribute at Offline Camp Oregon 2019.</p>

  <p>We'll review applications and notes from our screening calls on a rolling basis and using the following ranking factors as we select our campers: </p>

  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - We believe you will be a respectful and constructive participant in Offline Camp.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - We believe you have a valuable perspective to contribute to the conversation on the topic of Offline First.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - We believe you can provide a unique perspective that is not already represented in the mix of participants. This perspective might come from, for example, a difference in skills, background, role, gender, or race from other campers.</p>

  <p>Now that our early bird deadlines have passed, we're reviewing applications on a rolling basis and will make every effort to get back to you within a week of your screening call so that you have plenty of time to book your travel arrangements. If you're accepted, we'll send you a special booking link and will need you to pay for your ticket within 3 days, so that we have time to offer your bed to someone else if you've changed your mind.</p>


  <h3>Who else is coming to camp? How can we connect?</h3>
  <p>We don‚Äôt share campers‚Äô email addresses, even with our sponsors.  Instead, we encourage you to
    follow your <a href="https://twitter.com/OfflineCamp/lists/offline-camp-oregon-2019/members">fellow campers</a>
    on Twitter, as well as to <a href="http://offlinefirst.org/chat/">join the Offline First Slack team</a> and connect
    with other campers in the #camp channel before, during, and after camp.</p>

  <a name="pricing"></a>
  <h2>Camp Pricing and Scholarships</h2>

  <p> Camp pricing includes food and lodging, and varies based on when you apply. Be sure to take advantage of our early bird discounts!</p>

  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Super Early Bird (apply by May 17): $350 </p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Early Bird (apply by June 28): $450</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Fashionably Late Bird (aka Full Price): $500</p>

  <a name="scholarships"></a>
  <h3>Scholarships</h3>

  <p>We're excited to welcome a diverse group of campers to the Offline First community, including members of groups typically underrepresented at tech events, and we have both full scholarships and partial discounts available for those who need financial assistance. If the price of camp tickets ($500, which includes food and lodging) would normally keep you from attending, please note that on our Camp Application &amp; Scholarship Request Form.</p>

  <p>Our scholarships cover the full cost of your ticket, which includes your food and lodging during the event. At present, we do not have funding to cover travel expenses,
  but that may become available if we succeed at finding corporate <a href="{{ page.root_path }}camp/assets/Prospectus-Oregon-2019.pdf">Diversity Sponsors</a>. In the meantime, we have many campers who plan to carpool, which could help you save on travel expenses. (In 2017 there were carpools to Offline Camp from Medford, Portland, and Seattle.)</p>

  <p>Please don't let your financial circumstances keep you from applying to camp. Just <a href="mailto:camp@offlinefirst.org">reach out</a> with any questions. (And don't worry, how much you pay to attend Offline Camp is just between us.)</p>

  <a name="odds-and-ends"></a>

  <a name="diversity"></a>
  <h2>Diversity Statement</h2>

  <p>We believe that innovation is enhanced by a variety of perspectives, and that the future of the Offline First
  movement depends on embracing diversity. Our goal is to create an inclusive and respectful camp environment
  that encourages participation from all people regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual
  orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), technology
  choices, or depth of technical proficiency. (See our
  <a href="{{ page.root_path }}camp/codeofconduct.html">Code of Conduct</a>.)</p>

  <p>We're working to increase the diversity of Offline First and Offline Camp communities through our recruitment
  process and through dialogue with the broader tech and business communities.</p>

  <a name="diversify"></a>
  <h3>You can help us build a diverse camp experience by:</h3>

  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Encouraging attendees from groups underrepresented in tech to apply, or suggesting folks to whom we should reach out. (If needed, they can request a <a href="{{ page.root_path }}camp/faq.html#scholarships">scholarship</a> as part of the application process.)</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Forwarding information about Offline Camp to relevant affinity groups with the message that we are looking for a diverse mix of attendees and have scholarships available.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Making a personal donation to our scholarship fund <em>(coming soon)</em> to subsidize ticket costs (full or partial) for a potential camper who needs financial assistance.</p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - Becoming a corporate <a href="{{ page.root_path }}camp/assets/Prospectus-Oregon-2019.pdf">Diversity Sponsor</a> to fund a camper‚Äôs full camp experience, including travel expenses. </p>
  <p>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; - <a href="mailto:camp@offlinefirst.org">Sharing your ideas</a> on how we can make the on-site camp experience (or our web presence) more welcoming and supportive, free from intimidation and marginalization.</p>

  <p>We value diversity in the communities we serve, and we welcome your contributions to bringing balanced
  representation of the richness of our collective human experience.</p>
