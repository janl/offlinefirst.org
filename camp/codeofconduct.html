   <h2>The Offline Camp Code of Conduct</h2>

  <p>
    All attendees, speakers, sponsors, partners and volunteers at our camp are required to agree with the following code of conduct. Organisers will enforce this code throughout the event. We expect cooperation from all participants to help ensure a safe environment for everybody.
  </p>

  <h3>Policy for Enforcing this Code of Conduct</h3>

  <p>
    We are dedicated to providing a safe and comfortable space for all Offline Campers. If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other questions and/or concerns, please tell an organiser immediately. You can contact
    the camp organising team by <a href="mailto:camp@offlinefirst.org?subject=Code+of+Conduct+Help">email</a>, call Gregor directly at +1 (781) 363-4625, or talk directly to any <a href="#camp-organiser">camp organiser</a>. You will be able to identify camp organiser's at camp because we will introduce ourselves at the beginning AND we will be wearing "camp counselor" badges. 
  </p>

  <h3>The Quick Version</h3>

  <p>
    Our camp is dedicated to providing a harassment-free camp experience for everyone, regardless of gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion (or lack thereof), or technology choices. We do not tolerate harassment of camp participants in any form. Sexual language and imagery is not appropriate for any camp venue, including talks, workshops, parties, Twitter and other online media. Unacceptable behavior from any camper, including sponsors and organisers with decision-making authority, will not be tolerated. Anyone asked to stop unacceptable behavior is expected to comply immediately. If a camper engages in unnacceptable behavior, the organisers reserve the right to respond with any action the community deems appropriate, up to and including ejection from camp <em>without warning and without refund</em>.
  </p>

  <h3>The Less Quick Version</h3>

  <p>
    Harassment includes offensive verbal comments related to gender, gender identity and expression, age, sexual orientation, disability, physical appearance, body size, race, ethnicity, religion, technology choices, sexual images in public spaces, deliberate intimidation, stalking, following, harassing photography or recording, sustained disruption of talks or other events, inappropriate physical contact, and unwelcome sexual attention.
  </p>

  <p>
    Offline Camp is BYOB and as such, to ensure the safety and comfort of our participants, we have outlined an <strong>Alcohol Policy</strong>. Offline Camp will only provide non-alcoholic beverages to campers which means alcoholic beverages will not be sponsored. While this weekend is “BYOB” aka “bring your own beer,” excessive drunkenness will not be tolerated. As this is a professional event with a mission, things like drinking games, taking shots, etc., are not appropriate behavior. Organisers reserve the right to eject any participant who is exhibiting inappropriate drunken behavior up to and including the involvement of local law enforcement. It should also be mentioned that the presence of any illegal weapons, knives, fireworks, or illegal drugs is strictly prohibited from camp.
  </p>

  <p>
    Participants asked to stop any harassing behavior are expected to comply immediately.
  </p>

  <p>
    Sponsors are also subject to the anti-harassment policy. In particular, sponsors should not use sexualised images, activities, or other material. Camp staff (including volunteers) should not use sexualised clothing/uniforms/costumes, or otherwise create a sexualised environment.
  </p>

  <p>
    If a participant engages in harassing behavior, the camp organisers may take any action they deem appropriate, including warning the offender or expulsion from the camp with no refund.
  </p>

  <p>
    If you are being harassed, notice that someone else is being harassed, or have any other concerns, please contact a member of camp staff immediately.
  </p>

  <p>
    Camp staff will be happy to help participants contact hotel/venue security or local law enforcement, provide escorts, or otherwise assist those experiencing harassment to feel safe for the duration of the camp. We value your attendance.
  </p>

  <p>
    We expect participants to follow these rules at all camp and workshop venues and camp-related social events.
