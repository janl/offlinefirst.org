  <p>
    Offline Camp is an opportunity to bring together the growing <a href="http://www.offlinefirst.org" target="_blank">Offline First</a> community. 
    We explore the entire spectrum of Offline First including Progressive Web Apps, 
    mobile apps (native and hybrid), desktop apps (e.g. Electron), Internet of Things (IoT) apps, 
    the business case for Offline First, and the UX of Offline First. Offline Camp is an open, 
    participatory event. Please bring your perspective on Offline First and be willing to share — 
    and listen!
  </p>
  <p>
    We’re developers interested in making our apps work without constant
    internet connection. We’re designers exploring UX patterns that maintain
    user understanding of system state. We are all working on problems that very
    few have worked on before us, and we know it will take a wide range
    of points of view to solve the big challenges ahead of us.
  </p>

  <p>We'll be announcing our next camp location soon! Stay tuned for updates.</p>

<div class="main details">

  <h3>All within one (very) big house</h3>
  <p>
    Located in Santa Margarita, California, the camp will mostly take place inside one large lodge. There will be enough room to roam, relax, find solitude, and, of course, to collaborate.
  </p>

  <h3>Meals are provided</h3>
  <p>
    Catering will be provided, including vegetarian options. If you have any food allergies or dietary restrictions, please report them on your camper info form or <a href="mailTo:camp@offlinefirst.org">contact us</a>!
  </p>

  <h3>Code of Conduct</h3>
  <p>
    All attendees, speakers, sponsors and volunteers at our camp are required to agree with the Offline Camp <a href="../code-of-conduct/">code of conduct</a>. If you have any questions or suggestions on how we can make Offline Camp more safe and inclusive for campers, please <a href="mailTo:camp@offlinefirst.org">let us know</a>.
