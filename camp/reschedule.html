  <h1>Rescheduling Offline Camp Oregon 2019</h1>

  <h2><strong>Urgent: Oregon Wildfire and its Impact on Offline Camp</strong></h2>
  <h2>July 29, 2019</h2>


    <p>Many of you already know about the <a href="https://www.ktvz.com/news/milepost-97-fire-nears-12-000-acres-10-contained/1101188862">devastating Milepost 97 wildfire</a> currently burning in southern Oregon. Wildfires in the Pacific Northwest are unpredictable, incredibly dangerous, and absolutely no joke. Driving conditions will be poor and the air quality will likely be hazardous even for those folks not already facing respiratory challenges. Local fire services predict the fire will continue to push into the I-5, the main route to our venue, and the Air Quality Index in Grants Pass has reached levels ranging from unhealthy to hazardous over the past few days with the nearby fire being only 10% contained. Although the fire itself is not venturing toward Grants Pass, its smoke continues to head squarely in that direction, and our contacts on the ground at Cascade Mountain Ranch are currently advising against venturing outside without masks.</p>

    <p><em>Milepost 97 wildfire along I-5 in Oregon</em></p>
    <p><strong>For the health and safety of campers we’ve made the difficult decision to postpone Offline Camp.</strong> We’ve been working with our local partners to accommodate the rescheduling and have landed on <strong>September 27–30</strong> as the new date for Offline Camp Oregon 2019. We’ll be hosting it in the same location and under much safer and healthier conditions so that folks will be able to enjoy the true Offline Camp experience.</p>

    <p><strong>Your existing ticket applies to this new event date.</strong></p>

    <p>We know this is incredibly inconvenient, and understand that some of you may not be able to make the new dates. <strong>For your safety, we need to confirm that EVERY CAMPER has gotten this message and understands the change in plans. <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/1PscKaiGJM7lY5sG-HvXRcCCXq9nSBR8E26AUE1DCB8U/viewform?edit_requested=true">Click here to confirm.</a></strong></p>
