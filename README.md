## Running GitHub Pages Site Locally

If you'd like to run this GitHub Pages site locally with Jekyll, then follow these instructions:

1. [Install Ruby 2.1.0 or higher and install Bundler.](https://help.github.com/articles/setting-up-your-github-pages-site-locally-with-jekyll/#requirements)
2. From the root directory of this project, install Jekyll and other dependencies:  
```
$ bundle install
```
3. Also from the root directory of this project, build the local Jekyll site:  
```
$ bundle exec jekyll serve
```
4. Preview your local Jekyll site in your web browser at `http://localhost:4000`.

Steps 1 and 2 should only need to be completed once on your local development machine.
