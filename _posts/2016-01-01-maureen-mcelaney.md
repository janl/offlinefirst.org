### What do you find interesting about the concept of Offline First?

I love that Offline First shifts the focus of thinking first about your most vulnerable users and how they experience the usability of your application. You provide them with a feeling that even though they can’t complete a transaction in that moment, you care about their experience. For me, as a user, that would keep me coming back! 

### What motivated you to organise Offline Camp?

I’ve done Quality Assurance Testing and Automation, as well as worked within a Lean UX design cycle. I’m excited to immerse myself in a weekend of free form discussion with folks who are already building the future of Offline First, as well as folks who bring a fresh perspective.

### Who are you looking forward to meeting at Offline Camp, and why?


### What do you hope to be an outcome of Offline Camp?

My hope is that each camper walks away from Offline Camp with a new perspective on how they can contribute to Offline First. Changing this focus requires all of us to go back to our engineering teams and help rethink who our users are and what are their needs.

### Can you describe what Offline First means to you in a sentence?

To me, Offline First means more than just getting to play with the Chrome Offline Dinosaur. It means, feeling like the applications I use care about ME and the data I NEED. And helping to make sure our users know that we accommodated for them and thought first about the worst case scenario: No Internets! Yikes!
