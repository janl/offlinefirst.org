### What do you find interesting about the concept of Offline First?

Applications are built in a very controlled environment: in the programmer’s personal computer. When these applications get to the real world, they end up being used mostly through mobile devices with unreliable network connectivity. Developing applications that will deliver a good user experience in this adverse environment requires new technologies, techniques and approaches.

### What motivated you to organise Offline Camp?

In this first Offline Camp I’m hoping to meet the people that have been helping to bootstrap this concept and community. There, I’m hoping to learn about and discuss the problems, challenges and solutions that will help us deliver reliable applications that are resilient to poor or no network access.

### Who are you looking forward to meeting at Offline Camp, and why?

Anyone and everyone involved in developing concepts, approaches and technology to support the development of offline-first apps.

### What do you hope to be an outcome of Offline Camp?

I hope this first Offline First Camp allows us to grow the community, expands our common knowledge about the techniques and solutions, and enable this community to take this approach of developing applications to the mainstream.

### Can you describe what Offline First means to you in a sentence?

Offline First applications are applications that minimize their degradation when they have poor or no network connectivity.
