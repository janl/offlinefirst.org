### What do you find interesting about the concept of Offline First?

Embracing a design paradigm critical for low-resource areas of the world with unreliable connectivity to drive a positive change in modern web development.

### What motivated you to organise Offline Camp?

The opportunity to connect with some of the more important work (and people behind the work) in the sphere of Offline First design and development.

### Who are you looking forward to meeting at Offline Camp, and why?

Pedro from YLD (b/c we’ve been done work together on HospitalRun) and Gregor of Neighbourhoodie (b/c Gregor is a cool name :))

### What do you hope to be an outcome of Offline Camp?

A more organized effort to promote Offline First in critical spheres and communities of web development.

### Can you describe what Offline First means to you in a sentence?

Creating a software development reality where the lack of connectivity is no longer treated as an error condition.
